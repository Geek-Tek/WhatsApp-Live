# WhatsApp Live Chrome extension
This is a WhatsApp Web Chrome extension that allows user to read messages while they're written.
You won't need to wait until the other person finshes to write the message and send it.
Live chats are a lot more interesting and engaging, it's a new way of communication.

# Worth note:
This is the actual extension code, if you want to see or change the server-side code, you can go to LINK

# Additional info:
This extension was made in only a month by a 17 years old solo programmer without any previous knowledge of NodeJS, Express, Socket.io, GitHub or even Chrome extensions programming.
So please be kind and collaborative, help me improving this really fun project, thanks ; )
